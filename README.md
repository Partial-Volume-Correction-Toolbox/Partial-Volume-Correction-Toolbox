# Partial-Volume-Correction-Toolbox

This GitHub Organization repository has been established to house the development of the Partial Volume Correction Toolbox. This toolbox enables users to apply Partial Volume Correction methods, among other techniques, to brain PET images. It has been developed and designed by Mahnaz Shekari and Pol Díaz, with the collaboration of Fundació Pasqual Maragall.

# Requirements

To use the application, it is mandatory to have MATLAB and the appropriate license. Additionally, it is necessary to install the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/). Within the MATLAB application, it is also required to have the 'Tools for NIFTI and ANALYZE images' toolbox and the 'Medical Image Processing' toolbox installed.

# Installation

In the APPS section located at the top of the MATLAB home screen, clicking 'Install App' will open the files on your computer. Select the file Partial Volume Correction Toolbox.mlappinstall for installation. Once completed, the toolbox will be available, and you will only need to click on the corresponding toolbox logo to start using it.
